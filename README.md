# EasyFlash-Android-Flashlight

I wanted to have a go at making my own Android application, and decided on a flashlight app because I was tired of all of the ones I was using at the time. They all offered the same basic required function but were slow and sluggish due to all of the advertisements that were present. This app worked well for me for a while, but does not work on the most recent versions of Android due to changes in the way the Camera/Torch work, and the flashlight function being standard on most Android OS's now.
